This is a project that involves singly linked lists. There is a directory called "Tests" that is used for testing purposes. There is also a header file called "lists.h" that contains definitions and prototypes for all types and functions used in the project.

The main data type used in the project is a structure called "list_s". This structure contains three fields: a character pointer called "str", an unsigned integer called "len", and a pointer to another "list_s" structure called "next". The "list_t" type is defined as a typedef for "list_s".

There are five tasks in the project. The first task is to print all the elements in a linked list. The second task is to return the number of elements in a linked list. The third task is to add a new node to the beginning of a linked list. The fourth task is to add a new node to the end of a linked list. The fifth task is to free a linked list. 

There are also two additional tasks. The first additional task is to print a message before the main function is executed. The second additional task is to write a 64-bit assembly program that prints a message using only the printf function without interrupts.
